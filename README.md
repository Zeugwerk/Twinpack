# Twinpack 

The Twinpack Package Manager is a powerful and user-friendly package management tool for TwinCAT libraries. It is designed to empower the TwinCAT community by enabling sharing and distribution of libraries. It acts as a versatile platform similarly to NuGet (but with a PLC touch), allowing users to efficiently manage and deploy their custom-built modules.

Twinpack currently supports the following package sources

1. [Twinpack server](https://zeugwerk.dev/Zeugwerk_Framework/Documentation/snapshot/userguide/twinpack/twinpack_quickstart.html#using-a-package): Zeugwerk hosts open source libraries for and from everyone who is interested for free. Additionally this server type supports special features for Zeugwerk customers like feature branches.
1. [Nuget Server](https://zeugwerk.dev/Zeugwerk_Framework/Documentation/snapshot/userguide/twinpack/twinpack_nuget_package.html): Everyone can host his own NuGet server and create packages to consume them from the on premises server.
1. [Beckhoff Library Repository](https://zeugwerk.dev/Zeugwerk_Framework/Documentation/snapshot/userguide/twinpack/twinpack_beckhoffrepository.html): Since TwinCAT 4026, Beckhoff provides a public repository for their libraries.
